Hello.

0:02
Hi, is this Allison?

0:03
It is.

0:04
Hi, this is MJ from Local Student.

0:06
do you have a moment to speak?

0:08
I do.

0:09
Awesome.

0:10
yeah, I'm just following up on the email that you sent us, yesterday afternoon about wanting to start biweekly services with us.

0:16
Mhm.

0:18
OK awesome yeah no I can definitely get you booked in and actually since you're not doing your front yard anymore that reduces the biweekly pricing so 99 to 4999.

0:31
OK, I mean, I'm hoping that you know by the end of the sea that I'm hoping that you know I'll actually be able to have some grass in the front yard once it finally takes, but right now, yeah, it's, it's dirt and grass seed right now so.

0:45
Yeah, no, that's completely fine.

0:47
once you feel like you wanna add on the front yard as well, then we will have to adjust the pricing back to the originally quoted 5699, but for now it will be the 4999 so long as the front yard isn't included.

0:58
So just, just want to let you know about that change.

1:02
I also, you said you're looking for later this week or early next week.

1:06
I have availability with one of our top students on Tuesday, August 5th.

1:11
Does that work for you?

1:12
Yeah, that's fine.

1:13
And so then how so and so how does that work then in terms of even the the payment like the like you guys will invoice me and I can just pay you online or how do how do we set that?

1:23
Yeah of course I, I was just about to go over that OK yeah yeah so the way payment works is that we have a credit card or a Visa card on file and the card does not get charged until 24 hours to 48 hours after the service is marked is completed.

1:40
Oh, OK, perfect.

1:41
Yeah, so I can take the card information over the phone or I can send you a secure payment link, whichever you feel most comfortable with.

1:47
, no, I can give that to you.

1:49
Let me just grab my Wallet?

1:56
OK, so it's a Visa.

1:58
Mhm.

1:58
, and the number is XXXX

2:05
Mhm.

2:06
XXXX

2:08
Yeah.

2:09
XXXX

2:12
And can I get the expiry date, please?

2:13
Yeah, it's MM/YY.

2:16
And the security code?

2:18
YYY

2:21
And is the postal code associated with the card the same one as your address?

2:25
It is, yeah.

2:27
Perfect Awesome we're all good on that and just a couple more details I wanna go over just so I can make sure we're covering all our bases here.

2:39
Either way, once I make the booking, I'm gonna send you an email going over all of the important things that we're gonna discuss on this phone call as well.

2:46
OK,, so we do have a commitment period of two services for the biweekly services.

2:54
once those two services are completed, you are free to cancel whenever you'd like, if you feel like your grass isn't growing fast enough or for any other reason, however, so long as it's 48 hours before your next booking, however, if you choose to cancel before those two services are up, there's just a cancellation fee of 29.99 plus tax.

3:13
OK,.

3:14
Yeah, so, so nothing crazy.

3:16
I mean, usually most people get two services done anyways, and then another thing is I do want to ask, do you have any outlets available on the outside of your property?

3:26
No worries if not, just always good to note it down just in case we need to there's one, there's one basically at the front porch right next to the front door.

3:34
And then there's one in the backyard right on like basically at the deck right next next to the patio door.

3:39
So basically just next to the doors at the front and back.

3:42
OK, perfect, easy.

3:43
Wonderful.

3:45
and then, yeah, two more details.

3:47
One is our long grass policy.

3:49
, so if your grass is 5 inches or above, then that's when the policy comes into effect.

3:56
Do you know if the grass is 5 inches or above, or yeah, it's not.

3:59
No, it's not.

4:00
I have, I mean, I have been cutting the grass.

4:02
It's just now because my, my surgery date it's actually it's 2 weeks from today.

4:06
I just, I won't be able to keep cutting it, so.

4:09
Of course, no, totally understandable.

4:11
I mean that's why services like us exist exactly.

4:15
Yeah, no, OK, that, that's completely fine then.

4:17
I mean, I have to go over it.

4:19
Yeah, no, that's absolutely, that's understandable, yeah, but the surcharge is based off the length of the grass and it comes into effect once the grass is 5 inches.

4:27
If the grass is only 5 or 6 inches, then basically what we do is we surcharge your first service by usually 1.5, but since you're doing reoccurring services with us, it'd probably be less if it did apply.

4:39
, and the surcharge is based on the height, it's detailed in the email but it doesn't apply to you, so it's OK,.

4:46
And then one last thing is that we do offer our services up until the end of October.

4:51
I'm not sure if you want me to get you scheduled in up until the end of October.

4:54
Like I said, yeah, yeah, that would, that would be great because I think, yeah, the recovery period for the knee surgery actually is like it's 12 weeks so it takes me into early November.

5:04
So if I could schedule to the end of October, that would be great, yeah.

5:07
OK, wonderful, I guess that worked out well then.

5:10
OK,, actually do you guys do I can't remember if I saw it on the on the site.

5:15
, do you guys do like the fall like leaf clean up like the like stuff for leaves because I probably will have to do that as well because I have giant maple trees on my property and I don't know that I'm going to be able to do that.

5:29
Like I typically like no joke throughout the season like in the fall, I typically put out like between 35, almost 40 bags of leaves over the course of, yeah, like the maple trees are bigger than my house.

5:43
That's, I mean, that's incredible.

5:45
I mean that's in her backyard.

5:47
Yeah, those are actually the two of them are actually in the front yard.

5:52
The backyard isn't so bad.

5:53
It's, it's my, it's the neighbor in behind their maple tree overhangs my backyard, so I get leaves off of their tree, but it's not nearly as much as like the front yard is like if I didn't clear them, they like you wouldn't be able to cut the grass.

6:06
Because it's inches deep of leaves but if they, if I don't clean them up, yeah, definitely do leave clean up.

6:12
What we do is around like October November we send out like a huge blast email to all of our current customers, basically, yeah, going over it and if you need it you can always respond to us then.

6:24
But yeah we can definitely do that for you whenever you need, perfect, yeah, because it's, it's funny, you know, yeah like, you know, to schedule the like the, the lawn cutting, but you won't be able to cut the lawn because the leaves will be in the way.

6:36
Yeah, I know Yeah, I know even if you need it as early as October we offer them any any time of the year except for one year.

6:46
OK, good, good to know that's so funny, yeah, no, of course, alright, wonderful well then if you don't have any more questions for you, I'm gonna go ahead and create the booking, and then I'm gonna send you the booking confirmation email and otherwise you're good to go.

7:00
OK, I do have one quick question for you.

7:02
Like typically how long do you guys, when you cut it, do you cut the grass?

7:07
I don't like the I don't want the grass cut really short, only because the backyard is full sun and it burns.

7:13
So I try to keep it like a little bit longer, yeah, like at about like a like a 2 inch length.

7:19
Just so that it doesn't get burned I can just add in the notes to cut at a 2 inch length.

7:24
Yeah, like I just do like on my lawn mower I just cut it at not the longest setting but like the second longest they can adjust their their lawn mower like the height, yeah, so they can do 2 inches.

7:35
So I'll just just a little bit taller just because like even now like my neighbor, you know, cut my, I mean, God love him, he, you know, trying to help me out he cut he'll cut my grass every once in a while, but he cuts it so short like half of my backyard is brown now because it's.

7:49
He just, it, it gets burned.

7:54
I'm like, no, no, don't worry.

7:55
I said, you know, I know he's trying to help me.

7:57
I'm like, no, no, I'm hiring someone that's gonna get cut.

7:59
Don't worry about it.

8:00
Just worry about your yard.

8:01
Mine's good.

8:04
Well, that's, that's so nice of him, but yeah, no, this summer has been really rough.

8:08
I, it's so many people getting burned, but yeah, I'll definitely add in the notes then then to, to have a bit of a little longer, yeah, exactly, exactly, no, I can totally do that for you.

8:20
Do you have any other questions for me or no, that was, that's it.

8:24
All right, well, I'm gonna go ahead and make this booking for you and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

8:29
Great, thank you.

8:30
You too.

8:31
Thank you so much.

8:32
Take care.

8:32
Bye bye.

8:32
Thanks, thanks.

8:33
