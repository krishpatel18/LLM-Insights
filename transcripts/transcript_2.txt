Hi this is MJ from Local Students we're the ones who you sent a quote request to our website for lawn mowing services.

0:15
Mhm, yeah, yeah, do you have a moment to go over the quote?

0:18
Yeah, absolutely.

0:20
OK wonderful yeah so I saw that you were looking for reoccurring services for the rest of the season.

0:26
were you also looking for bagging of the grass clippings as well as our services normally just include lawn mowing and trimming of the edges, but we can do bagging for a small additional fee.

0:37
No, that's, that's fine, just, the mowing and trimming.

0:41
OK wonderful sounds good.

0:43
So yeah, if we're looking for, I'm gonna give you all the quotes even though I know you said you're looking for the rest of the season just in case you wanted to try it out, a one time service would cost $65 if you're looking for biweekly, so once every two weeks, that would be $56.99, and if you're looking for weekly, so once a week, that would go down to the lowest pricing of $47.99.

1:08
And our prices are subject to tax, but you know, like I said, it includes lawn mowing, trimming the edges, our students bring all of their own equipment.

1:16
And such and so forth.

1:18
So yeah, how does that sound?

1:19

1:21
I, yeah, I would be looking for weekly.

1:25
Weekly, yeah, we can definitely I think I mean I think so because I just.

1:29
It gets it gets unruly otherwise.

1:32

2:26
Oh yeah, no, that's completely fine.

2:28
I would say if you want to be like kind of I would say like at least 4 days, like 4 days is like a really solid amount of time, we can usually do it 2 or 3 days before you want the service done.

2:42
Oh, OK, no problem.

2:44
I just wasn't sure if I needed to, yeah, how far in advance.

2:47

2:58
No, you're you're completely OK.
