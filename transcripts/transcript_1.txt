0:05
We received a missed call from you earlier today.

0:08
I was just calling back to see how can I help you?

0:11
Yeah, I also got the message as well.

0:13
, I, I would like to find out more about your services and get a quote for, having my front and back lawn, mode as well as like I.

0:29
I do want to know like along the side of the, the lawn in the backyard, there's like, and even in the front there's like kind of like longer grass like weeds coming out.

0:39
Does that, is that taken care of as well while they're doing the mowing?

0:43
Yeah.

0:44
So, in the lawn mowing service, it is, what's included is the lawn mowing of the entire lawn as well as trimming the edges of the lawn.

0:56
OK.

0:57
OK, great.

0:58
Wonderful.

0:59
yeah, so I'm just curious about your prices and also when I'd be able to get it done.

1:03
Yeah, of course.

1:04
I'd be happy to give you a call right now if you are available.

1:08
Could I please have your address?

1:10
Sure, it's 5159 Sundial Court, S U N D I A L in Mississauga.

1:19
5159.

1:21
Yes.

1:22
Sun, S U N V I.

1:25
AL S U N D I A L.

1:34
S U N as in Nancy, D as in David, I as in India, yeah, alright, got it.

1:44
Alright, give me one moment as I verify the availability and then I'll also just size of your property, Just give me one moment.

2:01
OK, all right, and you were looking to get the front and the back of one mode, correct?

2:05
Yes, correct.

2:07
OK, what I'm gonna do right now is I'm gonna be sizing out your property and in the meantime, do you mind if I ask you a few questions regarding the service?

2:15
OK.

2:16
All right.

2:17
So first question, I'm taking a look at your property off of Google Earth here and in the backyard, it seems that there is some sort of deck.

2:24
Is that deck still present or?

2:27
There is, so what there is is there is a patio right like right out the back door.

2:34
Then there is a kind of like a gazebo type thing where there's like, obviously they wouldn't have to mow that area and then there's also a shed in the back, so I don't know how we the Google Earth.

2:47
Yeah, no, I see those things in the backyard.

2:49
OK, perfect, perfect, yeah.

2:50
And then in the very back there used to be a garden, but it's all grass now.

2:55
OK.

2:56
Oh, it needs to be a garden.

2:58
OK, got it.

2:59
All right.

3:00
And now to ask more questions about the service if we decide to proceed.

3:04
would you like to have the grass clippings bagged?

3:07
So it's either we can mulch the cut grass, leave it lying on the lawn, that acts as a natural fertilizer, or for a bit of an extra charge, we can also bag up the clippings and leave them on your curb.

3:17
What would you prefer?

3:18
, how much is the is the charge for the for bagging and clipping it or clipping or whatever.

3:25
Of course I can give you the quote for both of the options.

3:29
What you're more interested in?

3:30
OK, all right perfect and then just give me one moment.

3:36
Alright, and I wanted to ask if your grass has been cut in the season and when was the last time it was cut?

3:43
Last time it was cut was, I think the beginning of this month.

3:47
So I feel like it's just been like a few weeks.

3:51
All right.

3:53
OK.

3:53
And that leads me to my next question.

3:55
I wanted to ask if the grass is currently overgrown 5 inches or higher.

3:59
, let me just go take a look at it.

4:04
I don't think so.

4:04
I think it's towards the like the, the sides where you would usually use the term for some reason the grass is really, really high up there, not really, it's not like super, super high, but I don't think it's longer than 5 inches.

4:17
I, I don't know, to be honest, I'm like really bad.

4:20
OK, alright, that's all right if it's just like the edges, I just wanted you to know that for long grass taller than 5 inches uniformly.

4:28
, we do have an additional charge depending on the height just cause it takes extra time and effort to cut longer grass.

4:35
So what I can give you is I can provide you a range, just in the interest of full transparency.

4:40
So on the range on the low end, if the grass is 5 to 6 inches uniformly, it's not much, just 1.5 times the coded price, but it does go up from there based on the height.

4:50
So on the higher end of the grass is 1 ft high or even higher, it can be 3 times the Price or higher if the grass is higher, so I'm just letting you know that it falls on a range, but it probably most likely won't apply to you if like your grass was recently cut and it's not like uniformly overgrown.

5:08
Yeah, no, it's not uniformly overgrown and it's definitely not 3 ft,, yeah, because we just had it cut like like I said I think it was just like a few weeks ago so it's just because.

5:21
Oh yeah, I just, it's just looking a little bit messy now, specifically around the side so if someone would, yeah, so I just wanted to kind of get it all taken care of.

5:29
Yeah, of course.

5:31
All right.

5:32
So I have your quote ready here.

5:34
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna tell you the package and then I'm gonna, I'll give you the price without bagging and then with bagging, OK?

5:40
All right, so if you're looking to book a one time service without begging, it would be $75 plus tax and then with bagging it would be $83 plus tax.

5:51
If you're, yeah, $83 plus tax.

5:54
And then if you wanted to get reoccurring services, so one of our options is biweekly services, which is every two weeks.

6:02
without bagging, it would be $56.99 plus tax.

6:05
And then with bagging 63.97 plus tax.

6:09
And then if you wanted to do a more reoccurring service which would be weekly, it would be 5399 cent plus tax without begging, and then with begging, it would be 60.97 plus tax.

6:21
Yeah, I think I actually might go with the, like every 2 weeks, the 5 OK, alright, and you said that about 63, yes, 63 97% plus tax.

6:38
Sorry, I, you know what, I don't, I don't know if it's my phone, but I couldn't tell if you said 60 as in SIX or 50.

6:45
No, no, no, 66, like, SIS 63.97 plus tax.

6:53
Got it.

6:53
OK, that's for the every two weeks.

6:55
Mhm, that's for a biweekly with begging.

6:58
OK, so that, I will only need until like so this week, 2 weeks from now and then then 2 weeks from that so I would need it for the next because we're actually moving so.

7:16
So then like we'll be out of the house after that, so I, I would only really need it for the next 3 weeks.

7:23
OK.

7:24
I think the next 3, like 3 sessions of.

7:27
OK, OK, so you would want like 3 services of the biweekly services.

7:32
Thank you very much.

7:33
OK, I got, I got it.

7:37
OK, OK, alright, got that.

7:39
So you would like 3 services.

7:40
So, if we wanted to move forward it's biweekly, I'm just gonna let you know for our biweekly, we do have a commitment period because it is a reoccurring service.

7:49
There's a commitment of 2 services before any cancellations can be processed, but, this is.

7:55
Because it's offered at like a discounted price for having it done on a reoccurring basis.

8:00
However, like, if there is a cancellation before two services are completed, we do need to charge a cancellation fee of 29.99 cent plus HST.

8:10
However, after the commitment period, which is the two services, as long as you cancel outside of like 48 hours of your next service, there's gonna be no fee.

8:18
However, this doesn't really apply because you're gonna get 3 services anyway.

8:23
Yeah, yeah.

8:25
OK, oh that's fine, yeah, that's fine.

8:27
OK.

8:28
All right.

8:28
So after 3 services.

8:31
All right.

8:32
So would you like to move forward with the booking?

8:34
Yes, please, and also it's possible to have someone come either like today or tomorrow to do it?

8:42
I know it's like super short notice but I'm wondering if there might be a student available.

8:46
OK, so definitely not today because we do have to provide a bit of a notice to our students, However, what I can do for you is I can ask like our Mississauga students their closest availability.

9:00
And then based off their availability, they'll like have to let me know.

9:06
Yeah, so I could, like, I'll try my best to ask for tomorrow, but if like let's say tomorrow doesn't work, like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or those days, it's fine as well.

9:16
All right, that's fine.

9:18
OK, all right.

9:18
So what I'm gonna do for you right now is I'm gonna set up a profile for you just so we have all your contact information.

9:27

12:01
Yeah, so I do have one in the back.

12:16
So if they do and if they need it, I'll just make sure I'll try and make sure I'm home at the time that they're going to be here.

12:23
If not, I will somehow figure out how to leave the cord outside so they can just hook up their, their lawn mower, if they call me, I can speak to them directly about it.
