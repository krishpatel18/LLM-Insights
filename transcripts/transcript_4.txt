Hi, this is MJ with Local student.

0:04
How can I help you?

0:06
Yeah, I was looking at, lawn cutting services.

0:09
So what are your rates or do you, do you operate in the Parnell area in Markham?

0:15
We do operate in the Thornhill area and in Markham.

0:18
in order for me to give you a quote, if you could just let me know your address, then I can size up your property using Google Earth and give you a free quote right now over the phone.

0:26
OK, it's 39 McCauley Drive in Thornhill.

0:30
Ontario postal code L3T5S6, but if you're using Google Maps, I guess you just need the address, right for the Drive in.

0:45
Spell out the, the street name for me?

0:49
Could you repeat?

0:50
Could you spell out the street name for me, please?

0:53
M A C A U L E Y.

0:59
Macaulay Drive.

1:01
Perfect, thank you so much.

1:06
And you'd like both the front yard and the backyard done, correct?

1:10
Yeah.

1:11
For the front yard, I know that half of it is shared with your neighbor.

1:15
Do you only want your half and the smaller half is, yeah, yeah, that's right, half is mine, half of the neighbors, yeah.

1:21
OK, perfect.

1:22
Wonderful.

1:23
This will just take me a minute or two to do.

1:26
have you had lawn mowing services done before?

1:30
From a company you mean or?

1:33
Just in general from a company from an independent contractor.

1:36
Not, not really.

1:38
I've had some other, students on my street that do it, but they're, you know, they're away.

1:45
Yeah.

1:46
True.

1:46
, Yeah, just because local student, we, you know, it's nice where you get to support students as well as, you know, get the insurance along with the company.

1:57
So I'm just wondering if you had any experience, you know, with other services as well.

2:01
all right, awesome.

2:02
Your quote is almost done.

2:03
one more thing, do you normally like to have your grass clippings be bagged up or do you prefer to have the grass be left on top of the lawn to, you know, act as a natural fertilizer?

2:13
Well, they can.

2:16
Yeah, does that change the rates or what?

2:19
Yeah.

2:20
if I'm being completely transparent, bagging it up since it usually, you know, takes more time and such, it isn't a bit of an additional fee, just about $7 to $9 depending on the frequency of the service that you take, but it is additional.

2:34
Yeah, not particularly that they have to bag it up now.

2:39
OK, yeah, the majority of our customers go for no bagging anyways if I'm being honest with you, so yeah, OK, that makes sense.

2:46
That makes sense that's that's that's the easy part.

2:50
Exactly, well if we're looking for just a one time service then it would be $60.

2:56
If we're looking to go biweekly, so once every two weeks, that would drop down to 49.99.

3:02
And if we're looking to go weekly, that would drop further down to 4399, and these prices are subject to tax, but they include, you know, the whole lawn mowing service.

3:12
So lawn mowing as well as trimming, you know, with a weed whacker of the edges and such.

3:17
That's, that's not, not cheap, really, yeah, yeah, so you said the service for if you do it biweekly, what would it, what, what would it be still for biweekly it'd be 49.99 plus tax, And I will say all of our students, they do bring their own equipment and we would be able to assign a top student to your area, so a student who's been doing this for a couple of years now.

3:44
what?

3:44
Sorry, I missed that.

3:45
No, that's all right.

3:46
I was saying all of our students bring all their equipment and I could for your area I know that there's a top student who has been working with us for a couple of years now so he's well trained and and knows how to do a really good job so I would be able to assign you to a top student.

4:04
Yeah, it's just that your rates are kind of high for, for cutting the grass.

4:08
I mean, I, the students I use and I know you got other things to think about like, you know, in terms of, setting up an organization and all that.

4:18
Yeah, and, and it also helps that, you know, we're insured and such, so you know we want the students, yeah, yeah, I get, I get that.

4:24
I get that.

4:26
let me think about it.

4:27
So your services, and, and you would be able to provide somebody right away type of thing.

4:32
How, how, how, how does it work?

4:33
, so we can't do day of usually, it's usually pretty last minute, to assign someone the day of unless you call like right at 9 a.m. when we open, but for.

4:47
But we can usually do yeah the day before we can book you in usually if there's availability for the next day, so long as you call, you know, before like let's say 7 p.m., 8, like 7 p.m. would be the absolute latest, but for your specific area, let me quickly pull up the student map, in this next week I know it's gonna be raining a lot, so I would also try to assign you to a day where it isn't raining because then it would have to be delayed anyways and it, you know, it wouldn't make sense, but I believe for Thornhill.

5:17
I'll just make me 1 2nd while this thing loads up.

5:32
For Thornhill, yeah, we could do.

5:37
You know, even as early as this Saturday, we would be able to do we have a couple students who also work in.

5:46
That's that's oh wait, yeah, today's Monday.

5:50
Yeah.

5:50
, I could see if I can get you in on, sorry, Wednesday.

5:55
.

5:58
Yeah, I could probably try to get you on Wednesday or what we also can do is I know for a lot of our our clients what we do is we make an open booking like let's say you wanted it for tomorrow.

6:11
I can make an open booking for tomorrow and it's open to all of our students to be able to pick up.

6:15
, and they usually get picked up like if, if not the day before they get picked up the day of and if no students able to pick up the job then it just gets moved to the next day anyways.

6:29
Yeah, so you said, so what, what does it mean when you say biweekly?

6:32
What does that mean?

6:34
So that means you'd get a service once every 2 weeks, so basically twice a week for for how long for a month.

6:40
, well, we, for as long as we offer services up until the end of October, so you can do up until the end of October, but if you're wondering what the quote unquote minimum like amount is, we have a commitment period of one month.

6:56
So that only be two services and if you cancel before that one month is over, then there is a cancellation fee of 29.99 cent plus tax, but after that one month you're free to cancel whenever you'd like so long as it's 48 hours before your next service.

7:12
How long is what?

7:13
40 hours?

7:14
48, so, so long as it's 2 days before your next service.

7:18
Mhm.

7:21
02 days before your next service, so you still have the, you still have the second service, but you'd have to cancel before the 2nd service.

7:31
No, so you have to have, so the commitment period is for 2 services.

7:34
So if you cancel any time before those two services are completed, then there's the cancellation fee, but after those two services are completed, you're free to cancel whenever you'd like, so long as it's 2 days before like your next upcoming service.

7:50
OK.

7:54
Yeah, we're service.

7:54
OK.

7:56
Alrighty, that sounds interesting.

7:58
So it be, yeah, let me think on it for a bit and checking out a few different places, so I'll keep you guys in mind if it, makes sense.

8:09
Sounds good.

8:10
did you want me to also email these quotes to you so you can have it in writing or are you all right?
